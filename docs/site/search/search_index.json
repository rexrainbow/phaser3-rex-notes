A static body can never change position or angle and is completely fixed. isSensor : A flag that indicates whether a body is a sensor. Sensor triggers collision events, but doesn't react with colliding body physically. isSleeping : A flag that indicates whether the body is considered sleeping. A sleeping body acts similar to a static body, except it is only temporary and can be awoken. sleepThreshold : The number of updates in which this body must have near-zero velocity before it is set as sleeping. density : Density of the body, that is its mass per unit area. restitution : The restitution/bounce/elasticity of the body. The value is always positive and is in the range (0, 1) . 0 : Collisions may be perfectly inelastic and no bouncing may occur. 0.8 : The body may bounce back with approximately 80% of its kinetic energy. friction : Friction of the body. The value is always positive and is in the range (0, 1) . 0 : The body may slide indefinitely. 1 : The body may come to a stop almost instantly after a force is applied. frictionStatic : The static friction of the body (in the Coulomb friction model). 0 : The body will never 'stick' when it is nearly stationary and only dynamic friction is used. 10 : The higher the value, the more force it will take to initially get the body moving when nearly stationary. frictionAir : The air friction of the body (air resistance). 0 : The body will never slow as it moves through space. The higher the value, the faster a body slows when moving through space. force : The force to apply in the current step. angle : Angle of the body, in radians. torque : the torque (turning force) to apply in the current step. collisionFilter : An Object that specifies the collision filtering properties of this body. collisionFilter.group collisionFilter.category : A bit field that specifies the collision category this body belongs to. collisionFilter.mask : A bit mask that specifies the collision categories this body may collide with. slop : A tolerance on how far a body is allowed to 'sink' or rotate into other bodies. The default should generally suffice, although very large bodies may require larger values for stable stacking. Collision \u00b6 Collisions between two bodies will obey the following rules: (grpupA > 0) && (groupB > 0) : Collision = (groupA == groupB) (grpupA == 0) || (groupB == 0) : Collision = ((categoryA & maskB) !== 0) && ((categoryB & maskA) !== 0) Movement \u00b6 Velocity \u00b6 gameObject . setVelocity ( x , y ); gameObject . setVelocityX ( x ); gameObject . setVelocityY ( x ); Acceleration \u00b6 Force \u00b6 Applies a force to a body. gameObject . applyForce ( force ); force : {x, y} Applies a force to a body from a given position. gameObject . applyForceFrom ( position , force ); // position, force: {x, y} position : {x, y} force : {x, y} Apply thrust to the forward position of the body. gameObject . thrust ( speed ); speed : A number.
